# Laravel Migrations (Development)

During **development**, alter existing migrations in-place. Do not create new migrations to modify tables that already have migrations.

## Why

- Keeps schema clean and migrations reflective of the intended state
- Avoids migration sprawl before any production deployment
- Simplifies `migrate:fresh` and onboarding new devs

## Do

- Edit the existing migration file to add/remove/change columns
- Run `php artisan migrate:fresh` (or Sail equivalent) after changes
- Update models to match schema changes

## Don't

- Add a new migration to alter a table that was created in an earlier migration
- Keep both "create" and "modify" migrations for the same table in dev

## When to Switch

Once the app has **production data** or shared environments where migrations must run incrementally, switch to the standard approach: add new migrations for schema changes instead of editing existing ones.
