## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## SecureCAT development setup

**Recommended: Docker (Laravel Sail)** — no need to install PostgreSQL, Redis, or PHP extensions locally. On Windows use [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or Docker Desktop and run Sail from a WSL or Git Bash terminal in `app/`.

From the `app/` directory:

1. **Copy environment:** `cp .env.example .env` (or copy and edit). `.env.example` is already set for Sail (`DB_HOST=pgsql`, `REDIS_HOST=redis`, `DB_PASSWORD=password`).
2. **Application key:** `./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate` (or run `php artisan key:generate` if PHP is local).
3. **Start containers:** `./vendor/bin/sail up` (or `sail up -d` in background). First run will build images and start PostgreSQL and Redis.
4. **Migrations:** `./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate`.
5. **Verify (Phase 0):** `./vendor/bin/sail artisan route:list` · `./vendor/bin/sail artisan securecat:verify-env` · open [http://localhost](http://localhost) (or the port in `APP_PORT`) for the welcome page.

**Without Docker** (local PHP, PostgreSQL, Redis):

- Install PHP with `pdo_pgsql` and `redis` (phpredis) extensions (or use `composer require predis/predis` for Redis).
- Create the DB (e.g. `createdb securecat`), set `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`, `REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1`, and `DB_PASSWORD` in `.env`.
- Then: `composer install`, `npm install && npm run build`, `php artisan key:generate`, `php artisan migrate`, `php artisan serve`.
